# PC Troubleshooter v1.0 - Certification Summary

PC Troubleshooter is a self-contained Windows diagnostic tool with no external dependencies, using only standard Windows utilities (netsh, ipconfig, sfc, etc.) and NT services (Audio, Bluetooth, DHCP, DNS). The application requires runFullTrust capability for executing system commands and benefits from administrator privileges for full functionality including registry operations and service management. No special test accounts are needed - standard Windows user accounts with admin privileges are sufficient. The application performs no background audio usage, collects no personal data, operates entirely locally, and is GDPR compliant. Key features include network, Bluetooth, audio, display, storage, and performance diagnostics accessible through a professional dark-themed interface with system tray integration. Testing should verify UAC elevation prompts, all 20+ diagnostic scripts across 6 categories, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Q, F5, F1), and proper system integration without any background processing when idle.
